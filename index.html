    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Hussain Muhammad. I'm currently a Senior studying computer science at North Carolina A&T. I enjoy music, traveling, and spending time with family. When I am not in class I enjoy working out. I hope to learn more about JavaScript from this course and how to make websites dynamic for mobile.</p>
